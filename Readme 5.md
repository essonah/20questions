Guessing Game
Date: April 30, 2024

This assignment was actually very interesting and it made me understand how binary trees work
As i started the code, i was mixing up the binary tree implementation, with that of the linked list.
But i was able to figure that out later.
Amongst all the programming assignments we did this semester, I really liked this the most.
Even though, my code may not be working so well, I am very happy about the progress I have made during this course.

For the unrestricted game, i really struggled with having the newQuestion take in the place of the currentNode.
But i spoke to a Ta, and she was really helpful, she helped me think through possible ways i could do it.
I had to go through my notes about how binary trees work a couple of times, and that really helped.

And my printAnswers, even though the code works fine, I'm not sure that that is what you expect from us. I wrote the code in the inOrderTraversal and just called it in the printAnswers method. I couldn't think of any other way to do that, but was there any way else to do that, where the inorderTraversal will just go through the tree without printing, and printing out the values only in the printAnswer method.
